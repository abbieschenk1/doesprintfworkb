1. Open Terminal and run `pkgutil --expand [drag and drop the RecoveryHDMetaDmg.pkg in gibMacOS/macOS Downloads/publicrelease/xxx-xxxxx xx.xx.x macOS xxxx folder] Desktop/RecoveryFiles`By doing the above command, it will extract files from the recovery package and create a folder call RecoverFiles on desktop to save all extracted resources. 
2. Go inside the RecoverFiles folder, double click on RecoveryHDMetaDmg.dmg and the disk image should be mounted.
3. Go into the RecoveryHDMeta disk and copy BaseSystem.dmg to desktop.

6. Choose BaseSystem.dmg on desktop and press Restore.
