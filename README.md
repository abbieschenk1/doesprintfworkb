# Vanilla Intel & AMD Hackintosh Guide

Do you want a working Hackintosh without any other extra trash in your Hackintosh? Have you been waiting for a long time for an Intel & AMD Hackintosh Guide?

**Well, you have come to the right place!** ðŸ˜† 

This is a guide base on Intel Vanilla Hackintosh and there will be some more infomation and directions for AMD Vanilla Hackintosh in the guide. \(Unlike others, I only have AMD Hackintosh experiences. So, this gudie will be base on [Intel Vanilla Guide](https://hackintosh.gitbook.io/-r-hackintosh-vanilla-desktop-guide/) by CorpNewt and [Internet Install Vanilla Guide](https://internet-install.gitbook.io/macos-internet-install/) by Midi\)
