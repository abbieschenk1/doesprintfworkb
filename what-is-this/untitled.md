# Introduction

### General

So, first of all, what is "Vanilla Hackintosh"? Vanilla Hackintosh means a hackintosh setup that is as close to a real mac install as possible and being exclusive for your unique hardware.

**What's the different between "Vanilla" and "Niresh"\(distros\)?**

Niresh \(distro\) is an all in one installer which runs on all hardware. Although it has the most compability, they don't teach you anything and hackintosh doesn't meant for this. Also because of its compability, there will be more useless things \(like kexts and clover drivers, etc.\) in your hackintosh.

Vanilla, which means the most native method. In this way, you will learn how things work and that will be easier for debugging. And there will be less trash than Niresh \(distro\).
