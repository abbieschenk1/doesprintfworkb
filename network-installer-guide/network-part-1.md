# Preparing the installer - Part 1

## Get the macOS Installer from gibMacOS

1. Run the gibMacOS.bat \(Windows\) or gibMacOS.command \(macOS, with right-click open\) inside the downloaded or cloned gibMacOS folder
2. A Command Prompt window \(Windows\) or Terminal window \(macOS\) should appear. Enter `r` to toggle `Recovery Only` mode.
3. It should refresh the list after you toggle the mode. From there, you should see a list of macOS versions. Enter the number in front of the latest version \(by checking the date\) of **the highest supported macOS version of you system** which mentioned in [Requirements](../prerequisites/get-started/network-installer-prerequisites.md#requirements). You need to choose the one with FULL INSTALL.
4. Press Enter and it should start downloading. There should be only 1 item to download. Be patient while downloading the files.
5. Once it finishes downloading, you can proceed to the [next part](network-part-2/).
