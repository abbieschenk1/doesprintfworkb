# Posty!!!

I don't want to write anything more. [This page](https://internet-install.gitbook.io/macos-internet-install/posty-posty...) from Midi's guide contains all post install guide for Intel.

**AMD Ryzen?** Only one thing, AppleALC. [Here is the link](https://forum.amd-osx.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=6043&p=45449#p45449). Other things like USB Map will not work.

**AMD FX?** Uh-oh. You can basically do nothing but enjoy your macOS! ðŸ˜‰
