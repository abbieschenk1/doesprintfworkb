# Download the Installer

## Get the macOS Installer from gibMacOS

1. Run the gibMacOS.bat \(Windows\) or gibMacOS.command \(macOS, with right-click open\) inside the downloaded or cloned gibMacOS folder
2. A Command Prompt window \(Windows\) or Terminal window \(macOS\) should appear. **If you are doing a Network Installation,** enter `r` to toggle `Recovery Only` mode. Else, don't
3. It should refresh the list after you toggle the mode. From there, you should see a list of macOS versions. Enter the number in front of the latest version \(by checking the date\) of **the highest supported macOS version of you system** which mentioned in [Requirements](../prerequisites/get-started/network-installer-prerequisites.md#requirements).
4. Press Enter and it should start downloading. Be patient while downloading the files. - With `Recovery Only` turned **on**, it will **only download 1 file** - Without `Recovery Only` , it will download 11 files.
5. Once it finishes downloading, you can proceed to the [~~Network Installer Guide~~](../network-installer-guide/network-part-2/) ~~or~~ [Offline Installer Guide](../offline-installer-guide/offline-part-2/)
