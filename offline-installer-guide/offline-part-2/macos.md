# From macOS

1. Put the PackAppmacOS.py \(from MakeInstallmacOS\) into the downloaded macOS Installer files folder \(i.e.: `gibMacOS/macOS Downloads/publicrelease/xxx-xxxxx blah blah blah`\)
2. Run `python3 <drag and drop PackAppMacOS.py here>`
3. Choose A.
4. Choose the version you are installing.
5. The script should be packing your files to a Installer app. This may take time, be patient!
6. When it is done, proceed to [next part](../offline-part-3/macos.md).
