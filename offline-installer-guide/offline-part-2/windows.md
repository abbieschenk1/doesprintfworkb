description: Pack the installer to a folder with my script.
---

# From Windows

1. Clone my [MakeInstallmacOS Repo](https://github.com/doesprintfwork/MakeInstallmacOS) \(You'll need Python 3.4 or above for my script\)
2. Put the cloned folder into the downloaded macOS Installer files folder \(i.e.: `gibMacOS/macOS Downloads/publicrelease/xxx-xxxxx blah blah blah`\)
3. Run `python3 <drag and drop PackAppWin.py here>`
4. Choose P.
5. The script should be packing your files to a new folder call `SharedSupport`
6. You will be asked for getting the 7z.exe location. It is located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\7zip` Drag and drop the 7z.exe to the window and press enter. The script should continue to run.
7. When it is done, proceed to [next part](../offline-part-3/windows.md).
