description: Pack the installer to an app with my script.
---

# From macOS

1. Clone my [MakeInstallmacOS Repo](https://github.com/doesprintfwork/MakeInstallmacOS) \(You'll need Python 3.4 or above for my script\)
2. Put the cloned folder into the downloaded macOS Installer files folder \(i.e.: `gibMacOS/macOS Downloads/publicrelease/xxx-xxxxx blah blah blah`\)
3. Run `python3 <drag and drop PackAppMacOS.py here>`
4. Choose A.
5. Choose the version you are installing.
6. The script should be packing your files to a Installer app. This may take time, be patient!
7. When it is done, proceed to [next part](../preparing-the-installer/from-macos-offline-installer.md).
