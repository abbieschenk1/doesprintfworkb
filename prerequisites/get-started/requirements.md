# Requirements

## Requirements

* **AMD \(FX, Ryzen or Zen Athlon\) CPUs**
* **A dedicated GPU**
* _**Remember that the iGPU of AMD CPUs is not supported.**_
* For a complete list of supported GPUs, please refer to the [**GPU Buyers Guide**](https://khronokernel-3.gitbook.io/catalina-gpu-buyers-guide/) **and** _**remember your Highest Supported OS.**_
* As I haven't finished the Configuring Legacy Clover Part yet, this guide **requires a motherboard which support UEFI.** Sorry for keeping Legacy booting user waiting.
