# Requirements

## Requirements

* **Intel \(Core, Xeon or Pentium series\) or AMD \(FX, Ryzen or Zen Athlon\) CPUs**
* **Intel iGPU or a dedicated GPU.** _**Remember that the iGPU of AMD CPUs is not supported.**_ Either NVidia or AMD will work. **AMD GPUs are recommended** because of the native support from macOS Mojave. **Most of the NVidia GPUs can only goes up to macOS High Sierra** \(only Kepler GPUs are supported in Mojave\). For a complete list of supported GPUs, please refer to the [**GPU Buyers Guide**](https://khronokernel-3.gitbook.io/catalina-gpu-buyers-guide/) **and** _**choose the correct Installer according to your Highest Supported OS.**_
* As I haven't finished the Configuring Legacy Clover Part yet, this guide **requires a motherboard which support UEFI.** Sorry for keeping Legacy booting user waiting.
