# Network Installer Prerequisites

## Network Installer Prerequisites

{% hint style="warning" %}
You'll need to have **LAN \(Ethernet\) connection** if you are making a **Network Installer**. If you do _**NOT**_ have, please make an [**Offline Installer**](offline-installer-prerequisites.md) instead.
{% endhint %}

### General

* You **MUST** have fast Internet Speed \(at least 20 Mbps\). If your Internet Speed is slow, make an Offline Installer instead as the Installer might be locked while installing.

### Preparation for making an Network Installer from macOS

* [Clover install package](https://cloverdb.com) \(Get the latest and remember the version\)
* [Clover Configurator](https://mackie100projects.altervista.org/download-clover-configurator/) \(for editing the config\)

### Preparation for making an Network Installer from Windows

* [Clover Cloud Editor](http://cloudclovereditor.altervista.org/cce/index.php) \(You'll need this site later for making you config.plist\)
