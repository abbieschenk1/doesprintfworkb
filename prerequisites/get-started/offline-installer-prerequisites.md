# Offline Installer Prerequisites

### Offline Installer Prerequisites

#### General

* [macOS Installer](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Vi8LnhDlSD_qnw-nqIkAU7PFh0EWmEpB?usp=sharing). Choose the one according to your hardware. If you don't know which to choose, read the [Requirements](requirements.md#requirements) page.
* * You can also use your own macOS Installer. But if you are going to install macOS on AMD System, please make sure it is compatible to AMD. \(You can check the compatible version for AMD from the [AMD-OSX Github AMD\_Vanilla repo](https://github.com/AMD-OSX/AMD_Vanilla)\) I won't mention how to check the version here, google it yourself.
* **\[OPTIONAL\]** Fast Internet Speed

* [Clover install package](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cloverefiboot/)
* [Clover Configurator](https://mackie100projects.altervista.org/download-clover-configurator/) \(for editing the config\)
