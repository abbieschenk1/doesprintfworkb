## Clover Installation

1. Install Clover to your hard disk with the settings listed [here](preparing-the-installer-part-2/from-macos.md#part-2).
2. Then, mount the EFI partitions of your USB and your hard disk which has installed macOS \(mount it with Clover Configurator\).
3. Open both EFI partitions and replace the original EFI files in the hard disk with your USB files. \(Tips: hold down the `option` key to copy files and the merge option should appear.\)
