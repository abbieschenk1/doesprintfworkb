# Convert the Installer to offline

1. Run TransMac as administrator.
2. Choose your USB in the sidebar.
3. Go into Install macOS Install xxxx.app/Contents
4. Open your downloaded macOS Installer app and go to Contents folder.
5. Copy SharedSupport from the downloaded app to `USB/Install macOS xxxx.app/Contents` with TransMac. It'll take some time.
6. Done! You can now [install Clover](../from-windows.md#part-2)!
