# From macOS \(Network Installer\)

#### You'll need an ethernet connection while installing macOS with this method. For people who don't have an ethernet connection, go to [this page](from-macos-offline-installer.md).

## Part - 1

1. Rename the downloaded `RecoveryHDMetaDMG.pkg (or RecoveryHDUpdate.pkg)` to `RecoveryHDMetaDMG.dmg (or RecoveryHDUpdate.dmg)`
2. Double click on it and a new disk call RecoveryHDMeta \(or RecoveryHDUpdate\) should be mounted
3. Go into the RecoveryHDMeta \(or RecoveryHDUpdate\) disk and copy BaseSystem.dmg to desktop.
4. Go to disk utility. Click **View &gt; Show all devices** and find your USB **\(the whole disk instead of a partition, check out the gif below to know what I am talking\)** and format it to:  `Name:   [whatever you want] Format: Mac OS Extended (Journaled)  Scheme: GUID Partition Map`
5. Now, choose your **USB partition** click Restore button in Disk Utility and choose Image...
6. Choose BaseSystem.dmg on desktop and press Restore.
