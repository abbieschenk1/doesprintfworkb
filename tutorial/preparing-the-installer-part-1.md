# Preparing the installer - Part 1 \(Network Installer\)

## Get the macOS Installer from gibMacOS

1. Run the gibMacOS.bat \(Windows\) or gibMacOS.command \(macOS, with right-click open\) inside the downloaded or cloned gibMacOS folder
2. A Command Prompt window \(Windows\) or Terminal window \(macOS\) should appear. Enter `r` to toggle `Recovery Only` mode.
3. It should refresh the list after you toggle the mode. From there, you should see a list of macOS versions. Enter the number in front of the latest version \(by checking the date\) of **the highest supported macOS version of you system** which mentioned in [Requirements](get-started/prerequisites/#requirements). If you want to convert it to a Offline Installer, choose 10.14.1 or 10.13.6 in order to use the installer app downloaded. If there is no 10.14.1 nor 10.13.6 option in the list, you can get it from the installer app. The file is: `macOS Install xxxx.app/Contents/SharedSupport/BaseSystem.dmg`. You can directly go to [this page](preparing-the-installer-part-2/from-windows-direct-download/).  
   _**AMD Users:**_

   > _**IMPORTANT!**_ **Only choose 10.13.6, 10.14.1, 10.14.3, 10.14.4, and 10.14.5. Other versions are not supported.**

4. Press Enter and it should start downloading. There should be only 1 item to download. Be patient while downloading the files.
5. Once it finishes downloading, you can proceed to the [next part](preparing-the-installer-part-2/).
