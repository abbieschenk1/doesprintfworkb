## Clover Installation

Basically, Install Clover again with the settings which you have chosen for your USB. Then, mount the EFI partitions of your usb and your harddisk which has installed macOS. Open the both EFI partitions and merge the original EFI files in the harddisk with your USB files. \(Tips: hold `option` key to copy files and the merge option should appear.

## Others

I don't want to write anything more. [This page](https://internet-install.gitbook.io/macos-internet-install/posty-posty...) from Midi's guide contains all post install guide for Intel.

Here\(Link is down\) is another link for Post-Installation on AMD.

**AMD Ryzen?** AppleALC. [Here is the link](https://forum.amd-osx.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=6043&p=45449#p45449). Other things like USB Map will not work.

**AMD FX?** Uh-oh. You can basically do nothing but enjoy your macOS! ðŸ˜‰
